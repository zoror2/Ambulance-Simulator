Project Overview:

Goal: Develop a simulation for an ambulance route optimization system that dynamically adjusts traffic signals in real-time. The MVP will focus on a single ambulance and basic route optimization using Google Maps.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Project Setup:

Initialize Project: Create a new directory for your project and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project.

Set Up Frontend: Install React (or another frontend framework of your choice) using npx create-react-app.

Folder Structure: Organize your project into folders like /src, components, and public.

Google Maps Integration:

API Key: Obtain a Google Maps API key from the Google Cloud Platform.

Integrate Maps: Install the @react-google-maps/api package to easily integrate Google Maps into your React app.

Basic Map Display: Create a simple component that displays the map centered on a default location.

Basic Simulation:

Mock Data: Create mock GPS coordinates for the ambulance’s start and end points.

Route Calculation: Use the Google Maps Directions API to calculate the route between the start and end points.

Traffic Signal Simulation: Create a simple logic to change the traffic signal status based on the ambulance’s proximity to intersections.

User Interface:

Dashboard Layout: Design a simple dashboard that displays the map and the ambulance’s route.

Real-Time Updates: Implement basic real-time updates to show how the ambulance progresses along the route.

Testing the MVP:

Run the Application: Test the basic functionality locally to ensure the map displays correctly and that the route and traffic signals update as expected.

Post-MVP Enhancements:

Multiple Ambulances: Add logic to handle multiple ambulances and prioritize their routes.

Advanced AI Predictions: Integrate machine learning models to predict traffic patterns and optimize routes further.

Public Engagement: Develop a companion app for citizens to receive alerts and help clear the way.
